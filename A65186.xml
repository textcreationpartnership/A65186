            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is for your Diverſion, that this Treatiſe hath croſs'd the Sea, and undergone the hazard of a Voyage. If you meet here with any favorable Interpretation of thoſe pleaſant Dreams that ſoften your ſweet ſlumbers, commend the Author; if any thing falls out contrary to your expectation, blame not the Tranſlator, whoſe ſole deſigne was your ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This Tractate hath had the happineſs to breathe in the air of two forrain Kingdoms with Applauſe; thoſe of the moſt Catholique and moſt Chriſtian Kings; and beyond all controverſy, it will meet with no worſe Entertainment in a third, I mean that of the Defender of the Faith, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects come ſhort of none of the Europeans in civility. I confeſs that in this ſmall ſpot of ground, there
<pb facs="tcp:41829:3"/>grow no Rhetorical flowers; Here are no <hi>Ingenii laſcivientis floſculi;</hi> no Excreſcencies of Laſcivia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wit; for the ſubject will not admit of a florid ſtile: yet I'll be bold to affirm, here's that which ſtamps the Impreſſion of beautiful upon the World, and renders the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe Amiable, Variety. <hi>Ineſt ſua Gratia parvis,</hi> is a Sentence that carries as much Truth as Antiquity in the womb of it; and Nature hath ever been ſo provident, as to ſupply the want of Bulk in minute things, with an Exact Symmetry, and Comely Proportion. And herein Art (her Chiefeſt Ape) doth nearly imitate Her: for indiſputably there was more Artifice and ſubtilty manifeſted in the ſmaller proportion of <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Iron fly, then in the larger Dimenſions of his Wooden Eagle.</p>
            <p>The Author in his diſcourſe upon this Subject, intends no Rigorous Impoſition upon your faith, nor to Commit a Rape upon your Belief; for ſuch Arts, as this of <hi>Oneiropolie,</hi> have no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to ſupport them, but the inſtable Baſis of Conjecture. This was not invented to unhinge the Brain, or torture the Phancie; but rather to Divert, and Exerciſe in your Ladyſhips that pleaſant Ague of the Diaphragm, Laughter. The moſt refined Wits that ever I met with in this our Modern Age, when tir'd out in the eager purſuit after ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer learning, as the noble Recerches of Philoſophy, or dark Intrigues of State-Politie, have ever had recourſe to ſome ſuch Innocent Divertiſement, which like Hellebore purgeth away Melancholie, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demique diſtemper of the ſedentary Student. Well may I therefore, with modeſty, trace the footſteps of ſuch Eminent Authors, and plead that old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:41829:3"/>for taking up this new Subject (for I preſume there are few Tracts of this nature in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and feweſt in our Own.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quod decuit Tantos, cur mihi turpe putem?</hi> The Rough-draught of this Tranſlation, was the Product of ſome of thoſe <hi>Horae ſubſecivae</hi> that were ſnatch'd from the Hurry of a Tumultuous City-employment, and ſince lick'd into that ſhape wherein it is now preſented to your Ladyſhips, under the quiet calm of a Rural Recreation. I have met here with ſome Galliciſms, or French Idioms, which were ſo peeviſh and ſullen, that they would not, by any means, be perſuaded to ſpeak plain Engliſh; in ſo much that I was conſtrain'd to force them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the moſt familiar Terms, and uſual expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our Language. The Alphabetical Table of Dreams is inverted, becauſe they would not follow in the ſame order in Engliſh as they did in French, but I have neither added to, nor diminiſh'd the number of them, and ſo conſequently have done the Author no injury, having only in ſome particulars deviated from his Method, for the Reader's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. As for that additional piece of Phyſiognomie; which is the very ſtudy of the Complexion, I need ſay but little in vindication of it. 'Tis a known Proverb, <hi>Facies Index Rerum:</hi> the Character and ſentiments of the Mind, are plainly and fairly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in the Countenance; nor will it ever enter into my thoughts, that you can poſſibly have any Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for an Art, whoſe chiefeſt ſubject is that Part your Ladyſhips are ſo curious, by all Artificial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments and Auxiliatory Helps imaginable, to preſerve. But leſt I be accus'd of too much Rudeneſs for detaining you ſo long in the Porch of this Palace,
<pb facs="tcp:41829:4"/>I will now open the Portal, and give you free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into this <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Curioſity;</hi> where, that the Entertainment may in ſome meaſure Anſwer your Expectation, it is the earneſt deſire of</p>

                     <p>YOu muſt lay your fingers on one point of the Figure following, and count till you come to Twelve, either upward or downward, on the right or left ſide; and then reckon the number of points that remain to the very and of the corner of the Figure, and no further: and retaining in your memory the remainder over and above the number Twelve, then go to the Queſtion propos'd, and count downwards from the ſame number which you had remaining; and then look for the number in the Anſwers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number you meet with after you have done counting at the Queſtions; and then come to the Anſwer for the Queſtion according to the firſt number retain'd in your memory. <hi>For Example:</hi> If the Perſon that is Curious toucheth that point with his finger which is mark'd with the figure 2, then drawing downwards as thoſe ſmall points ſhew you, you muſt count till you come to Twelve, and then reckon the three that remain to the right corner at the lover end of the Figure; and ſo come to the Queſtion, which was this, <hi>Whether a Perſon ſhall have many
<pb facs="tcp:41829:5"/>Friends;</hi> which is the ſeventh Queſtion: ſo that reckoning the three that remain, you proceed till you come to Nine, which ſignifies the ninth Number, and the third Anſwer; which is this: <hi>You ſhall have many Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, for the ſame Queſtion: Suppoſe you touch at the Figure 3, and count upwards (as you ſee the pricks go) till you come to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there remain five, with you are to reckon from the Queſtion, accounting always the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it ſelf to be one; and that will bring you to 11, which is the Number of the Anſwers: then five the number remaining, as before, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you to the ſame Figure in that Number, where you finde this Anſwer: <hi>You ſhall have true Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note alſo, that if you chuſe any of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions towards the end, you muſt (after you have counted all to the bottom) begin at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning again. <hi>For Example:</hi> Suppoſe you chuſe the 49 Queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall overcome in a Duel?</hi> and you touch at 4 in the Figure; you muſt count as you ſee the pricks, and there remain ſeven: then you turn to the Queſtion before, where you reckon from 49; and becauſe you can reckon but four of the ſeven to the bottom, you begin again at one; ſo that you finde three the number in the Anſwers, and ſeven in that Number, as before, where you have this Anſwer: <hi>They will have no advantage one of another.</hi> And ſo of the reſt.</p>

                  <head>A TREATISE OF Nocturnal Dreams and Viſions, AND Of their SIGNIFICATIONS, According To the Opinion of the Ancients.</head>
                  <p>DReams and Viſions are infus'd into men for their advantage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Wherefore God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth in the ſacred Pages, that he will <hi>pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joel <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>their ſons and daughters ſhall prophecie: The old men dream dreams,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and the young men ſee viſions.</hi> And both ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hiſtories are ſo fully furniſht with variety of examples concerning the true event of many Dreams, that it would argue incredulity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in natural cauſes, not at all to credit them. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is of opinion, that whilſt the body ſleeps, the ſpirit is awake, and tranſported unto all places where the body could have acceſs; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41829:22"/>that it ſees and knows all things which the body could know and ſee when awake, and toucheth all that it could touch: In ſhort, that it hath all the operations that the body, now aſleep, can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of when awake.</p>
                  <p>There are five ſorts of Dreams, that have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent names according to their different qualities. The firſt is a <hi>Dream:</hi> The ſecond a <hi>Viſion:</hi> The third an <hi>Oracle:</hi> The fourth a <hi>Phantaſie,</hi> or vain <hi>imagination:</hi> The fifth an <hi>Apparition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is called a <hi>Dream,</hi> which diſcovers the truth under a hidden Figure; as when <hi>Joſeph</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Dream of the ſeven lean King that ſhould devour the ſeven fat ones; and the ſame of the ears of Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Viſion</hi> is no other then this; when a man really ſees awake, that he did aſleep; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> when he ſaw the Chirurgion that drew out <hi>Nero's</hi> tooth.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Oracle</hi> is a revelation or advertiſement made to us in our ſleep, by ſome Angel or other Saint, to perform Gods Will according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; as it hapned to <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Husband of the holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> and the three <hi>Magi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Phantaſie</hi> or vain <hi>imagination</hi> happens in that inſtant when the affections are ſo vehement, that they aſcend up to the brain, during our ſleep, and meet with the more watchful ſpirit: then what the thoughts are employ'd about in the day, we fancie in the night; ſo an <hi>Inamorato,</hi> who in the day-time thinks on his Miſtreſs, in the night, when aſleep, he meets with the ſame thoughts:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41829:22"/>
                     <q>
                        <l>— Nam mens humana quod optat</l>
                        <l>Dum vigilat, ſperans, per ſomnum cernit id ipſum.</l>
                        <note place="margin">Cato.</note>
                     </q>
So when a perſon thinks to meet with any thing, oftentimes it falls out, that in the night-time he Dreams he hath met it. It happens alſo that he that faſts all day dreams at night that he is feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if he had any thirſt in the day-time, in the night he dreams of drinking, and is very much delighted with it. And the Miſer and Uſurer dreams of Bags, nay, will diſcourſe of them in his ſleep.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Apparition</hi> by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Phantaſm,</hi> and is no other then a Nocturnal <hi>Viſion</hi> that preſents it ſelf to weak Infants and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient men, who fancie they ſee <hi>Chimaera's</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to intimidate or offend them.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe five ſorts of Dreams, the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have ſome appearance of truth, but the two laſt are altogether fallacious.</p>
                  <p>Yet you muſt obſerve this of all the Dreams, that thoſe that leave no impreſſion upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory are inſignificant: and thoſe which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, muſt be, if good and true, about day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, or at the leaſt after midnight; for till then all the ſenſes and faculties of the body are buſied about digeſtion; and the ſpirit being diſturbed by the vapours that ariſe from the meat, and ſeat themſelves in the brain, the Dreams are to little or no purpoſe. Yet <hi>Artemidorus</hi> affirms, that he that is ſober and undiſturb'd, may dream at all times, even in the day, and there may be a certain event of them.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41829:23"/>
                  <p>Some Authors make a threefold diviſion of Dreams, <hi>viz.</hi> into Dreams of Natural, Animal, and Celeſtial things. Natural things are thoſe by which Phyſitians judge of the humours; dreams of things Animal, are ſuch as owe their being to the paſſion and the trouble that the ſpirit was infeſted with in the day-time; and the Celeſtial are advertiſements of things that are Divine; as that of the Statue which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> imagin'd he ſaw in his ſleep, which is ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately portraicted by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as we read it hapned to a Priſoner in the little<note n="*" place="margin">The name of a Priſon in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </note> Chaſtelet at <hi>Paris,</hi> who dreamt that whilſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> were putting the halter about his neck to hang him, that he ſaw an unknown perſon that came to his reſcue with a ſword, and took off th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> rope; which the next day hapned accordingly: for the Judge having pronounced ſentence of death, and committed him to the Executioner; he was reſcued by ſome perſons that came <hi>incognito,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by his friends to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is Allegorical, or ſignificative, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it happens not according to the Dream, but by a riddle; as when we dream of ſeeing an Angel, that ſignifies revelation, or good news; to ſee a Serpent that endeavours to do miſchief, ſignifies envy, and tribulation from envious perſons.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41829:23"/>
                  <p>Speculative Dreams have an immediate event, but the Allegorical not ſo ſoon; for there is a days time or two, between a Dream, and the Event thereof, ſo that ſometimes a man may deceive himſelf in this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether he muſt attend the ſucceſs according to the Dream, or judge it will fall out contrarily; which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only by learned and prudent Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Sometimes there are monſtrous Dreams, which ought not to be liſted in the number of thoſe that are ſpeculative; they are ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly happen, as when you Dream that you fly, have horns, go down into hell, theſe are of the nature of thoſe that are Allegorical, which carry a different ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Dreams are proportion'd according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the party Dreaming: Thus thoſe of Eminent perſons, be they good or bad, will be great, <hi>viz.</hi> if good, they ſignifie great benefit; and on the contrary, great miſery. If the Party that Dreams be of a mean condition, the Dreams with their events will be means alſo; if poor, their Dreams will be very inconſiderable: for the Rules of Dreaming are not general, and cannot ſatisfy all perſons one way; but ſometimes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to times and perſons, they admit of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious interpretations.</p>
                  <p>They that Dream of acquainting a ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with buſineſs that belongs not to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or trade, that happens to themſelves; but when they ſeem to give any advice tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their own trade or profeſſion, that happens to others; and he that Dreams he practiſeth what he heard, that is an extraordinary good ſigne,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41829:24"/>and he will proſper in his trade or profeſſion. A Graecian Phyſician Dreaming that he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe another not to marry a wife that was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it hapned that this Phyſician eſpouſed a Roman Dame, that brought him much trouble. <hi>Heraclides</hi> the Tragoedian being at Rome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for a diſputation about the Art of Tragoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diography, Dream'd in the night, that he was to maintain a diſpute with the Tragoedians and Judges; and yet notwithſtanding on the morrow he was overcome in the diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes our Dreams have a true event, though diametrically oppoſite to our hope and deſire. <hi>Amilcar</hi> the Carthaginian General, beſieging a Town in <hi>Sicily,</hi> dream'd he heard a voice, that aſſur'd him he ſhould ſup in the Town to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; which wrought upon him ſo effectually, that he did hope and beleeve he ſhould take it that day; and to that end having given order to his Soldiers for a general aſſault, a diſſention aroſe among the variety of nations that made up the compoſition of his Army, ſo that the Town ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of this opportunity, ſallied out, and attaquing that place where <hi>Amilcar</hi> then was, took him Priſoner, and conducted him to ſupper in their Town; and ſo his hope was fruſtrated, but not the Dream.</p>
                  <p>The Valiant and Reſolute, as alſo the learned underſtanding perſons in the affaires of this world, whoſe ſpirits are diſtracted neither with hope or fear, are not ſo inclinable to Dreams and Phantaſies, as the timorous, ignorant, and thoſe of the vulgar, who phancy nothing all night but what took up their thoughts in the day-time.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41829:24"/>
                  <p>Now it is convenient to produce examples of all ſorts of Dreams that have a true event. The firſt ſort is called a Dream.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Son of <hi>Jacob</hi> Dream'd that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſheaves made obeiſance to thoſe he had made: and again he had another Dream; The Sun, Moon and eleven Starres ſeemed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; which was true; For being by God's grace and favor eſtabliſhed Governor of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, He furniſhed his Brethren with corn for their ſuſtenance, during the famine, together with his Father and Mother; and after his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of himſelf, he beſtowed on them great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and gave them the Land of Goſhen to dwell in. King <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Butler, being impriſon'd, Dream'd in the night, that he ſaw a vine with three branches that flouriſhed by degrees, and after it had bloſſom'd the ripe grapes appear'd, and he ſeem'd to have the King's Cup in his hand, and that he preſſed the grapes, and ſtrained out the wine, which overflowed the Cup he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King. <hi>Joſeph</hi> interpreted this Dream, and ſaid that the three branches were the three days that the Butler was ſtill to remain a Priſoner; which time expir'd, King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would be mindful of him, and reeſtabliſh him in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſerve him as before: which had a true event.</p>
                  <p>The King's Baker,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.</note> who was a Priſoner at the ſame time, Dream'd that he carried three Baskets of meal upon his head, and that in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt there were all ſorts of Viands that could be praepar'd by the Baker's art, and that the birds eat of it. <hi>Joſeph</hi> in like manner interpreted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41829:25"/>this Dream, and ſaid, that the three Baskets ſignified three days, at the end whereof King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would cauſe this poor Baker to be hang'd: which had an event ſuitable to the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p>The ſame King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Dream'd that he was ſtanding near a River out of which there came ſeaven well-favour'd and fat Kine, which were devour'd by ſeaven other meagre and ill-favoured to the ſight. The ſame night he Dream'd alſo and Phancied that he ſaw ſeaven full ears of corn which were ſwallowed up by ſeaven other dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>THis (courteous Reader) is all I can acquaint you with concerning Dreams, making it my requeſt, that you would not pin your faith upon them ſo far, as to create any diſturbance within your ſelf thereby. It is ſaid that Dreams, for the moſt part, are but fables; and I often find this Proverb true: and when you underſtand that meats are the cauſe that Dreams are good or bad, joyful or ſad, pleaſant or diſturbing, you will then be ſatisfied that they fall out as well by accident as neceſſity; and conſequently, that you ought not wholly to depend upon them. Thoſe Dreams that may have a true event, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from wiſe and ſober Perſons, that are gifted with a ſettled mind and ſolid judgement: for they that are of a contrary temper, can have no Dream that deſerves an interpretation, or that can poſſibly happen. The Affections and afflictions diſcompoſe the minde, and have more power to make it extravagant Sleeping then waking. Too large a quantity of Meat or Wine, or the deprav'd quality infus'd into them by a thouſand kind of ſauces and ingredients which are added thereunto, or otherwiſe, not being taken at certain Hours, all theſe things debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate and ſtupifie the body, diſturb the minde, and produce confus'd and extravagant Dreams, which are altogether inſignificant, and which ſhould rather oblige the wiſe Interpreters and Explainers of them to cenſure ſuch Dreamers, then to afford them any hope of good ſucceſs. So that you ſhould judiciouſly diſcover the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you are in when you Dream, before you give credit thereunto.</p>

                  <div type="introduction">
                     <p>THis Treatiſe muſt neceſſarily prove advantagious and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, not only becauſe it concerns every individual perſon, but alſo becauſe there are few men of what quality or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but are intereſted in things of this nature. The Divine, Philoſopher, Phyſician both of ſoul and body, the good Chriſtian in the regulating of his inclination, the Gentleman that earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires an honeſt and agreeable converſation, may gather from hence ſomething which may prove an additional advantage to him in his profeſſion; in fine, every perſon may hereby attain to the knowledge of himſelf, which is to be valued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all treaſures and riches imaginable. The Divine is here concern'd, becauſe that thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Agitations that are laid open to his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41829:77"/>view, which anticipate reaſon, do oppoſe virtue, ſeduce the will, and conſequently are the chiefeſt cauſes of ſin. Wherefore the Doctor in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that treats of our ultimate end, and the means to obtain it, ought neceſſarily to extend his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to ſubjects of this nature. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers both natural and moral, are deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and bend their minds to this ſubject. The Natural Philoſopher, who contemplates on the Nature of Man, enters into the diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Actions, without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attain the knowledge thereof. The Moral Philoſopher perſwading men to Virtue, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them from Vice, demonſtrates how out diſordered appetite ought to be curbed by the greatneſs of our reſolution and moderation: And I do here declare their nature and ſubtilty, in what ſort of people they are moſt vehement, and in whom alſo moderate.</p>
                     <p>The devout Preacher that perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands by theſe ſymptomes the age, ſex, nature and property of thoſe perſons with whom he converſeth, may beyond all diſpute create ſtrange alterations in the minds of his Auditory. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Preacher in a famous City, who had ſo great an influence upon the affections of his Auditors, that he could at his pleaſure draw abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears from them, and upon the change of his diſcourſe convert their grief into joy. The reaſon is this, becauſe that he himſelf being much addicted to that kind of paſſion, and exquiſite in the art of moving his Auditory thereunto, he could perſwade to whatſoever his phancy led him. The ſame benefit may be made by all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41829:77"/>as Ambaſſadours, Lawyers, Magiſtrates, Captains, and all others, that would perſwade a multitude: Much might be ſaid of this matter, but I will touch it briefly elſewhere, as alſo the remedies ſuitable to the defects we ſhall find or judge of by our art.</p>
                     <p>And as this Treatiſe is of great advantage to the Phyſician of the Soul, it is no leſs to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of the Body; for there is no violent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but creates ſome extraordinary alteration in one of the four humors of the Body. And all Phyſicians agree in this, that of all extrinſick cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diſtempers, one is, (and that none of the moſt inconſiderable) the violence of ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paſſion: for although it hath unhing'd their brains, as well as the Natural Philoſophers, to find out the cauſe how an operation lodged in the underſtanding can alter the body, and move the humors from place to place; yet they all concenter in this opinion, that they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a certain natural Sympathy, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of one part to the other; and that the Spirits and Humors treat their paſſions as Lords and Maſters. So that the Phyſician underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what paſſion cauſeth the diſeaſe, may very well inferre from thence what humor abounds; and conſequently, what is to be purged, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to be applied, and how it may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be prevented.</p>
                     <p>If all theſe Profeſſions prae-mentioned have a ſhare in this diſcourſe, the good Chriſtian indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably, whoſe life is a war-fare upon earth, he who makes it his chief ſtudy to extirpate vice and cultivate virtue, he who pretends to be piloted
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41829:78"/>by reaſon, and not to be tyranniz'd over by any prepoſterous affection; This perſon (I ſay) can better dive into, and meditate upon this matter; he can ſoon find out where theſe Serpents and Baſilisks neſtle, which draw out the pretious blood of his ſoul; he can diſcern where the thorn is fixed that pierceth his heart; in fine, he will find out his domeſtique enemies that always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb his peace, moleſt him in proſperity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him in adverſity; make him diſſolute in pleaſure, and deſperate in ſorrow; furious in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, trembling in fear, and languiſhing in hope. It was under ſuch temptations as theſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did puniſh his body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Caſtigo corpus meum &amp; in ſervitutem redigo.</hi> I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection. Theſe were the members that the Apoſtle exhorts us to mortifie here upon earth; ſaying, <hi>Mortificate membra veſtra quae ſunt ſuper terram.</hi> Seeing then how the life of a ſpiritual man ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the expugnation of theſe importunate <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> doubtleſs it is a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for him to underſtand the nature of his enemies, their ſtratagems and dayly incurſions, even to the chiefeſt Citadel of his Soul, I mean the Spirit and Will.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Chriſtian alone concern'd in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of his paſſions, but alſo the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and prudent Politician by prying into the nature and quality of his affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining their irregular motions, will be Maſter of a moſt complaiſant deportment and preſence, and by this means may gentilely inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the friendſhip of other men. When he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41829:78"/>travels into forrain parts, he may diſcover to what paſſion the people are moſt inclinable: for as I have found by experience, there is no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> but hath ſome extraordinaay affection, as Pride, Anger, Uncleanneſs, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Idleneſs, or ſome ſuch paſſion. It is a matter of great moment in ſociety, to underſtand the inclination of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you aſſociate with; and that converſation cannot but be agreeable, where the paſſions of the parties are moderated. I will ſay nothing of Magiſtrates, who may by Phyſiognomy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the diſpoſition and inclination of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors and Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But to cloſe up all, the ſubject of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I am upon comprehends the principal object which the ancient Philoſophers ever aim'd at, and wherein they placed the greateſt part of their felicity; that was, <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelf: which knowledge conſiſts in the exact experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that every man hath of himſelf in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and an univerſal knowledge of men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

                        <p>IT is very requiſite and neceſſary that he that will take upon him to judge others, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things truly underſtand his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by what paſſions his ſoul is moſt ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for there is no man that enjoys the benefit of the common air, but is more inclinable to one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41829:79"/>paſſion then another. Now the means to attain to ſuch a knowledge, are theſe. Firſt, a ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of your natural conſtitution; for the cholerique are ſubject to impetuoſity, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholique to ſadneſs, the ſanguine to pleaſure, and the Phlegmatique to ſloth and drunkenneſs. Then, conſider what company you moſt phancy, they are the mirrour wherein you may take a ſurvey of your own ſelf; for every individual perſon affects him that moſt reſembles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                     <p>THe Heart being the ſeat of our paſſions, the ſpirits and humors concur, aſſiſt, and incline it to ſuch operations. Hence we may draw an undeniable and advantagious conſequence, that perſons are ſubject to different paſſions, according to the diſpoſition of the heart, body, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors thereof; and that the ſame paſſions affect divers perſons variouſly: for, as we ſee fire prey upon iron, wood, powder, or towe, in a different manner; for in wood it is kindled with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and not eaſily extinguiſhed; Tow is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fir'd, and as readily put out; but Iron is heated with great difficulty, and with as great difficulty quenched; Gun-powder is catcht at in a moment, and can never be put out, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes: So you will meet with ſome men that are not eaſily provok'd to anger, and yet with much facility mov'd to mirth; and ſuch for the major part are Phlegmatick: many Engliſh men
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41829:79"/>are of this temper. Others are ſuddenly paſſionate, and appeas'd in a moment: this is uſual in the Sanguine; and there are more <hi>French</hi> of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, then of any other Nation. Others are with much difficulty offended, and ofterwards will hardly be reconcil'd: The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> are often found of this temper. Some are all fire, inflam'd in a moment, and quit not their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of revenge, till their hearts are almoſt conſum'd with anger. This confirms the old Proverb, <hi>Animi mores corporis temperamentum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur;</hi> The diſpoſition of the ſoul follows the temperament of the body. And as in diſeaſes of the Body every wiſe man underſtands beſt his own grief, ſo in diſtempers of the mind every one knows beſt his own inclination, which the <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo ſubjugates</hi> by his reaſon.</p>
                     <p>We may confidently and inoffenſively conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, by the teſtimony of approved Authors, that the People and Nations which inhabit the ſeveral parts of this vaſt Univerſe, have ſtrange and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite diſpoſitions. As the Northern Inhabitants are uſually bigger, ſtronger, and fitter for labour than the Southern, whoſe bodies are weaker, but their ſpirits more ſubtile. But you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe of the middle Region, who lye between the North and South, are not ſubject to extream heat or cold, and yet able to undergo both. We will briefly diſcourſe of every one in particular.</p>

                        <p>AS to their bodies, they are cold and dry, of a ſmall or middle ſtature, their eyes black, and like the Northern people, are ſtrong and ſtout, ſo that the weak conſtitution of theſe is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the extraordinary indowments of the mind. They are taxed with cruelty: peruſe the Hiſtory of <hi>Africa, Leo Afer,</hi> and the diſſentions of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> for to give them their due, all tortures had their originall from them, as Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Exoculations, Excoriation, breaking upon the Wheel alive (which the <hi>French</hi> ever deteſted; but by reaſon of horrid treaſons committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they borrowed theſe puniſhments of their Neighbours) and to the end that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould imagine that this cruelty is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their education, which nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the nature of the <hi>Americans,</hi> who banquet it among the dead carkaſſes of their enemies, and quaffe their blood. If any perſon objects, that the ſame or like cruelty is committed by the people of the North; I will intreat him to take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his conſideration with this difference, which is, that the Northern people are tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fury by the heat of their courage, and openly purſue their revenge, where being provok'd; and their paſſion allay'd, they are eaſily appeas'd; but thoſe of the South are not ſuddenly mov'd, but being once urg'd, they are not without difficulty reconcil'd.

For through <hi>Idleneſs</hi> they ſcarcely underſtand what belongs to manuring or ſowing the ground; they content themſelves with paſturage, and that which the Earth freely yields them to feed their flocks. They exerciſe no Art, nor Trade, judging it a derogation to their nobility, of which they make a great ſhew: and thus they paſſe away their days in a villanous idleneſs, and had rather reſiſt thoſe many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities which proceed from their barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by patience then laboriouſneſs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo little of pleaſure, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of miſery. They defend themſelves againſt the injury of the rain and cold with a ſingle mantle, and being addicted to hunting, grow as ſwiftfooted as wild Beaſts. If they are weary or benighted, they are content to make the Earth their bed, where they will take out their uſual nap, and not be wakened by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of the weather, though covered all over with ſnow, or dropping wet with rain. They are obſtinate in their Vices, hating labor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>THe Italians have a ſpirit capable of all things, and are addicted to Vice or Virtue not through any inconſiderate violence, but with election and judgement; they are very courteous in their Entertainment, and make uſe of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the body and perſuaſive expreſſions, to give you an aſſurance of their affection. They are not eaſily wrought upon to diſſolve the bond of friendſhip; and when they have contracted it, there is no danger but they will expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, rather then violate it: but if they once hate, their enmity is the more dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can craftily conceal it, and yet retain the remembrance of an injury receiv'd deeply engraven in their mind: when offended, then are they moſt ſerviceable to you, to the end that they may the better proſecute their revenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maſque of friendſhip, when occaſion is offered: nay, their hatred is long-liv'd, and laſts for a continuance, and oftentimes they are with as much facility provok'd, as with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty appeas'd. Their tempers are attended with a ſevere and melancholique prudence; ſo that it is a hard matter for them to ſupport the chearfulnes and gayety of others; and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to do or ſay any thing at random, and without deſigne, they cenſure others by their own cuſtome, and by a ſuperfluous kind of nicety, obſerve the meaneſt geſtures in the eyes and diſcourſe of others, thereby judging of their

                        <p>THe Spaniards always and conſtantly retain the habits and diſpoſition of their Anceſtors; they are robuſt, and patiently undergo labor; not that laboriouſneſs that is exercis'd in Husbandry, nor in Arts or Trades; but that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in War, as Vigilancy, Hunger, Thirſt, Cold, Heat, in a word, the obſervation of Military Diſcipline: for they being conceited with what they once have in expectancie, judge that the chiefeſt part of Virtue conſiſts in the flighting evil and danger. They are proud and ambitious, nor are they hurried on to ſeveral deſignes with violence, and know as well how to overcome, as improve a victory. They being alſo opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in all ſorts of danger, neither the Time nor Enemy can overcome them; and it is a buſineſs of no ſmall difficulty to ſtagger their reſolution, to which they ſeem to be ſuited both by nature and diſcourſe: but the words with which they magnify themſelves and their own Nation, nay their very countenance, which agrees with their ſwelling expreſſions, are unwelcome to the Hearers; and their converſation is odious to thoſe that are of an ingenuous temper. They are better in company then ſingle: They love to be well accoutred, and boaſt of their Apparel; being very niggardly in other things, and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in eating and drinking: full of Rodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado's, eſpecially to thoſe that either ſtand in awe of them, or indulge their humor. Their fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41829:93"/>and ſobriety is wonderful, not only in <hi>Spain,</hi> where it is extreme hot, but in all parts where they live at their own proper expenſe; then a ſmall quantity of bread and a little ſalad will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them; but when they are at another mans Table, they feed as if they had a Legion in their belly, ravenouſly and gluttonouſly. Beſides, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digencie is no Allay to their Pride; for you may find among them ſome raſcally Coblers, that bear as much ſaile, and are bladder'd up more then Perſons in the higheſt degree of honor among other Nations. Nevertheleſs many of them have more oſtentation then reality; They for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality contenting themſelves with pitiful pay in ſome Garriſon, where they miſerably paſs away their days. They are inwardly cloſe, and move ſlowly in all buſineſs: are fit to attend upon and execute long-winded deſignes. They can ſuit themſelves either to Peace or War, as the times require, and uſually overcome by the Aſſiſtance of their ſilver; by which means they have triumph'd over the moſt invincible Nations: and it is very cuſtomary with them to make uſe of the pretext of Religion to promote what they undertake, or procure reverence to themſelves: They Cloak their avarice with the veil of God's Worſhip, and yet have ſuch prodigious ſucceſs in all their attempts, as if they only fought the Battels of the Almighty. Now that which is moſt commendable in this Nation is, that in ſo great a ſcarcity of Men, they yet keep under their Subjection, by their great prudence, ſo many large Provinces that are ſo far diſtant one from another. There is nothing idle or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41829:93"/>in their diſcourſe, but a converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to ingenious ſpirits, that are capable of all things. When they begin to treat or enter into friendſhip with a perſon, there is nothing ſo charming, and you muſt entertain them at the ſame rate; but if they once, through Pride, come to extol themſelves, it lies on your part to give them an equal return. If fortune hath ſubjected you to their diſcretion, you muſt be humble and ſubmiſſive, and prodigal in commendation of them and their Country; and as they are liberal in their promiſes, ſo you muſt not ſcruple to give them a verbal engagement, though beyond your ability, to get out of their cuſtody.</p>

Their prodigality is the off-ſpring of the cofidence of their ſtrength and ability, by which means they think they ſhall be greater gainers. Their Incontinencie, Audacity and Confidence proceeds from the heat abounding in them; and thoſe that are of a hotter conſtitution, are more ſubject to theſe Affections: they are very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and ſeldome continue in one mind, which partly proceeds (as I conceive) from the various alterations in their Bodies, which eaſily work a change upon their deſires; and partly alſo for want of mature reſolution and ſolid judgement, becauſe as they uſually change their opinions, ſo do they alter their determinations.</p>
                     <p>Old Men are quite contrary, for becauſe they have been deceiv'd, they aſſure themſelves of nothing; promiſe nothing, are dubious in all things, take all in the worſt ſenſe, and never repreſent any thing to themſelves, but what is evil; are ſuſpitious and miſtruſtful, which are the effects of that fear that freezeth their heart, and of that experience they have of the Infidelity of men: are very Avaricious, Contentious, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at every inconſiderable thing, yet weakly; are Penſive, which I find to proceed from the froſt in their blood; are faſridious and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, for <hi>Ipſa ſenectus morbus eſt,</hi> Old age it ſelf is a perpetual malady; they are obſtinate in their opinion, and many of them blame young men for their want of experience and practice, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying to themſelves, that wiſdome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41829:94"/>is found no where but under a Night-cap, hence ariſeth that ſpirit of contempt, by which they debaſe young men: and as Travellers for the moſt part diſcourſe of the prodigies they have heard and ſeen in forrain parts, ſo old men relate the things they have ſeen or heard in former times.</p>

This may proceed from ſome defects in the Organs of the ſpeech, the difficulty of conception, or elſe from a certain weak conceit that men have of their own wiſdom, which they diſtill before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>guttatim,</hi> as the water drops from an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembick;</hi> for they are of this perſuaſion, that if they ſhould be more deliberate in their delivery, they ſhould forfeit part of their prudence: and really among perſons of an ordinary capacity and dull apprehenſion, it were well if they were not ſo prolix; for oftentimes before they bring their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a period, they forget the beginning; but with ingenious men, it is an affront to their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor can it be but very incommodious to them; like a man that hath drink given him drop by drop, when he is extream thirſty; which could not chuſe but offend him, though the liquor were never ſo good; ſo a man of a quick wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy underſtanding, deſires preſent ſatisfaction; and this is the cauſe why men of ſlow ſpeech are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much againſt his inclination. Yet for all this, I muſt confeſs that this way of ſpeech agrees very

They may well be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to certain birds that ſing charmingly, but have no fleſh on their bodies; they reſemble ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated Courtizans, who ſhroud their foul diſeas'd and fleſhleſs carkaſſes under rich robes. You will ſcarce find one among a thouſand of them, whoſe conceptions are attended by ſolid judgement. Theſe men trifle away their time, and ſtudy inqueſt of bombaſt terms; and that which they conceive not without great pains, they deliver not without much toile; They are guilty of many miſdemeanors, and are often troubled with haeſitation: If their diſcourſe be long-winded, the Epilogue is generally a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Prologue: If they write any thing that is to be expos'd to publique view, you always meet with ſome new-coin'd word forg'd in the Mint of their own Brain, and that becomes them as well, as the giddy feather in a Fools

                        <p>I Acquainted you in our entrance into this Treatiſe, that the things Men moſt affect is aſually the ſubject of their diſcourſe: but becauſe ſome people governe themſelves with more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion then others, we muſt take them into a more ſtrict examination. You will find many that diſcourſe of matters beyond their ſphere, as the Cobler of Cavalry, the Taylor of Theologie, the Farmer of Phyſique, and the Coſſin-maker of the Philoſopher's Stone: in ſhort, a great number of Men will intermeddle with matters that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend their capacitie, for want of Exerciſe, Study, or Practice. I have ſometimes heard ſuch kind of Quacks diſcourſe in Philoſophie ſo ſoberly, yet with ſo much obſtinacie, that they have run into the groſſeſt errors that can enter into the Imagination of Man. I am of opinion that every honeſt Man that hears them, will place them in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41829:103"/>the Predicament of Fools; and you muſt know, that if any Lord or Gentleman is ſo ſimple as to pin his faith upon the ſleeves of ſuch kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then they conceit that they can with eaſe practiſe thoſe Arts and Sciences which they judge themſelves capable to diſpute of; which is never done without prejudice to many poor people, who are of this beleef, that their Lord is infallible in things of this nature. There are more of theſe Doctors in <hi>England,</hi> then in any other place, that I know of. In the years 1622 &amp; 1623, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with a certain Lord, who was one of the higheſt quality in that Kingdom, who having heard the diſcourſe of one of your pretended Doctors concerning Alchimy, he inſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the Chambers ſhould be made ready, the Fornaces fitted for ſo noble an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and that Alembicks, Glaſſe-bottles, Stills, Lamps, Fornaces, Stillatories, Phials, Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latories, Pellicans, Crucibles, Veſſels, Bellows, Coles &amp; ſuch other Inſtruments ſhould be bought forthwith: the deſigne of this Nobleman was no other, then that this Laboratorie ſhould be a place where all his Inferiors, as well poor as rich, ſhould have acceſs to disburthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their misfortunes: but all theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are reduced to one, which is <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> into which he ſometimes puts a flower, at other times Cinamone; ſometimes pepper, ginger, fennil, aniſe-ſeeds, and many others, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes new names on them according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the ſeed which he intermixeth with it. The vulgar, who judge only by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and relie upon the authority of other
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41829:103"/>perſons, without examining things by particular diſcourſe or argumentation, are ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in theſe matters; and ſo for the future commit the cure of their bodies to ſuch Ignaro's as do very much injure them. I have met with one, that had an indifferent ſtock of diſcretion, who knowing it was a piece of greater difficulty to do then ſay a thing, he did avoyd, as much as in him lay, thoſe that were ſick, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd phyſique to none but thoſe that were in health; or if to others, he ſo ordered it, that it was not known. He gave a Doſe of his Chimical preparations to a friends Wife of mine who was with Child, which wrought with her ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upward and downward, for the ſpace of four days, that ſhe was every day given over for a dead Woman. He gave a poor Maid that was troubled with a Catarrhe, ſuch violent vomitive potions, that ſhee became impotent ever after. I could recite you a ſcore of ſuch examples. But to returne to the matter in hand, I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this kind of diſcourſe or diſputation is the effect of much ignorance and arrogancy; no wiſe Man ever enters upon a diſpute he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not; whence came that common Proverb, <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi> let not the Cobler go beyond his Laſt: for confirmation of this, I ſhall bring no better an argument, then every mans own experience. There are few (if I miſtake not) but what employ themſelves in one profeſſion or other, either in this ſcience, or that kind of practice; <hi>e. g.</hi> a Printer or Goldſmith being Maſter of his Trade, if a perſon altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in his Art ſhould come to engage in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41829:104"/>with him and condemne him, becauſe he makes uſe of ſuch and ſuch Inſtruments, of this or that way of working, would not he ſmile at him, and take him to be an ignorant Man, that adventures to ſpeak of what he underſtands not? So certainly let men be aſſur'd, that if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of a thing they are ignorant in, they muſt of neceſſity be accounted preſumptuous. Yet we do not diſallow ſome ingenious Perſons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their doubts in matters which they are not exerciſed in, as Lawyers to diſpute in Divinity, the Phyſician of Law, the Divine of Phyſick, and eſpecially with them that have the repute of Maſters in theſe faculties: this rule admits of an Exception; for there are ſome Divines that are very able Phyſicians, and Lawyers that are not ignorant in Divinity, Nay Phyſicians that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand both theſe ſciences; in ſuch caſes thoſe of one profeſſion may be excellent in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another; but this is very rare, becauſe that he that labors in the purſuit of divers ſciences, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily excel in any. This is the reaſon that thoſe that are illiterate, if diſcreet, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no queſtion above the reach of their capacity; or if they do, it is in ſuch a way, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to learn, rather then argue. But how ſhall a Man behave himſelf, if he fall into the Companie of ſuch Diſputants, that are neither capable of making any intricate propoſition, nor of returning any grounded or ſolid anſwer? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably 'tis a vexations thing to aſſociate with ſuch Idiots; yet the beſt way I know to deal with them, is to detect their Notorious ignorance by ſome palpable abſurdity.</p>

In a Caſe of this nature, which may often fall out, it were well to be furniſhed with a ready retort, as <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> did reply to an Orator that recited a long Oration in his praiſe; The King ſaith, <hi>If what you ſay be truth, I thank God for it; if not, I pray God give me the grace to deſerve it:</hi> Or a diſcreet Perſon may ſay, I deſerve not this applauſe, but your affection puts this gloſs upon my actions, the better to ſet them off; or elſe you, out of your good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and love to me only, take more notice of the little good I do, then the great evil I am guilty of: again, the affection you bear me, conſtrains you to make the beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all my actions. By this means you evade a vain complacencie in your affaires, that miniſters occaſion of offence to the cenſorions; nor muſt you be ſo rude as to deny what your Friend out of civility affirms to be really true.</p>

                        <head>Of concealing or revealing Secrets.</head>
                        <p>AS there are ſome Perſons ſo cloſe, that they will never diſcover any thing of buſineſs; ſo on the contrary there are others ſo fooliſh, that they will diſcloſe their thoughts to any one, eſpecially thoſe that concern themſelves. The former are crafty and ſubtile at firſt, becauſe friendſhip requires ſome communication of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41829:106"/>eſpecially if he be a ſingular friend; and this offence may very well be tolerated in this dangerous age, where profit is diligently ſought after, and friendſhip deſpis'd, or at leaſt men affect one another more out of intereſt then for the love of virtue. Wherefore he that is wiſe will confide in no man, unleſs it be in matters pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely to be known, or that he be a choice friend, of whoſe friendſhip you have had long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; but if he be vitious (if there can be any friendſhip between vitious perſons) aſſure your ſelf that if you acquaint him with halfe your mind, you have even publiquely diſcovered the whole: for ſuch perſons uſually, if they be young Men or Women, or of no great credit, are litigious, and very indiſcreet in their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Beſides, their friendſhip having no other Baſis but their own Intereſt, as pleaſure or profit; if either of theſe faile, then be confident that they will reveal all they know of you: becauſe ſuch imprudent perſons as theſe imagine, that the friendſhip being once broken, they are no longer oblig'd to keep your ſecrets, or ſave your credit; and ſo in the turning of a hand, all is diſcover'd. Therefore I take it for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, that a Man is bound to reſerve his ſecrets of greateſt importance within his own breaſt; or not to diſcloſe them to any, but him that he knows to be a faithful prudent and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous friend.</p>
                        <p>There is another ſort of Men, who very well deſerve the name of Deceivers as well as friends: for in appearance they pretend friendſhip, but in effect 'tis nothing but flattery and diſſimulation:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41829:106"/>they come to you very ſeriouſly, and tell you ſome ſtory in private, conjure you not to divulge it upon any termes: you promiſe ſecrecie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it; but this pretended friend himſelf will not keep it ſecret; for as ſoon as your back is turn'd he will do as much to another, it may be two or three more; and ſo you ſhall hear that publiſhed openly, which you thought a great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. This kind of deceit is the Child of great craft, and a feigned friendſhip: for true amity admits not of plurality of perſons in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of ſecrets. I have known many ſubject to this paſſion, but in proceſs of time they have been much troubled at it: ſober men ſmile at a perſon that they underſtand to be ſuch a Revealer of ſecrets.</p>

Thoſe, whoſe Hair in their youth grows white or gray, it ſignifies a luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, vain, lying, inſtable, talkative perſon. Thoſe, whoſe Hair is of a moderate growth, both in quantity and colour, it is a ſigne that they are bent and more inclin'd to good then evil; loving a peaceable life, honeſty, and are of a good temper.

In Children, much Hair denotes future melancholy; ſhort Hair ſtaring up like briſtles, ſignifies a ſtrong, bold, vain perſon, very fallacious, deſirous of beauty, and more fooliſh then wiſe. Thoſe whoſe Hair is but moderately curl'd, it ſignifies the perſon to be of a dull nature, and ignorant. Thoſe that have ſtore of Hair, are voluptuous, and of good digeſtion, vain, and eaſily induc'd to be cruel; of a treacherous memory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.
